# WP GraphQL Jetpack Related Posts

Gives the related posts of a given post as a GraphQL Field.

This is a very simple plugin I created for my Gatsby blog.

You need to have already installed the [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) plugin on your WordPress site in order for this to work.
